# Prediction
This code uses regression in order to predict future values basing on historical data. 

We can use MS Excel file with historical data. Many variables have to be situated in columns. One column - one variable. 
An argument wanted_item is explained variable - we try to predict it. 

First object - param_materiality - we can use to check which variables are important. Special information will be printed. 
Then we can delete other variables and use once again file with historical data. 
It is important to remember that files with historical data and future data (also MS Excel) will have to have the same explanatory variables.
